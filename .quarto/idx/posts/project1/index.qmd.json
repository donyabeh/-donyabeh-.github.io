Our lesson plan was informed by our reading on constructivism and cooperative learning. First, we know that box plots are a difficult and new concept for students to understand at first without using scaffolding strategies. To support student understanding of this new topic, we will be providing students with dotplots, then having the students recall prior knowledge related to dotplots to construct boxplots (i.e. calculating the median, identifying minimum and maximum values, what one dot on the plot represents in context, etc.). Additionally, we will be using ideas of cooperative learning in our lesson plan. For example, students will be formed into groups of two and asked to work together on the given handout. To include individual accountability, we will tell students that random members of their group will be called on to share their answers after completing the handout. Furthermore, while the handout is mostly group work, we will have students complete the \"exit ticket\" questions independently, ensuring individual accountability.\n\nPrior to this lesson, students need to recall how to construct a dotplot and what the distribution represents (i.e. \"what is one dot on the plot?\"). Moreover, students should be familiar with calculating the median from a dot plot distribution and raw data table. Students should be able to recognize the minimum and maximum values on a dot plot as well. In previous lessons, students have learned about constructing a dot plot from a table of data. Students learned how to calculate the median from the data table, as well as marking and interpreting the median on the dot plot distribution. Additionally, students were able to recognize shapes of dot plots (symmetric, right skewed, left skewed). In our lesson plan, students will be introduced to constructing boxplots. Specifically, students will learn about using the five number summary (minimum, quartile one, median, quartile two, maximum) to draw a boxplot. Students will also learn how to calculate and interpret the IQR.\n\n# Lesson learning goals\n\n1.  Apply previous knowledge of center and spread for dot plot distributions in order to describe and construct box plot distributions.\n\n2.  Identify and compute each component of the five-number summary of a boxplot (minimum, quartile one, median, quartile two, maximum).\n\n3.  Interpret quartile one and quartile three of boxplots in context.\n\n4.  Compute and interpret IQR in the context of boxplot distributions.\n\n5.  Construct a box plot.\n\n# Common Core Standards:\n\n\"Summarize numerical data sets in relation to their context, such as by...Giving quantitative measures of center (median and/or mean) and variability (interquartile range), as well as describing any overall pattern and any striking deviations from the overall pattern with reference to the context in which the data were gathered.\"\n\n\"Display numerical data in plots on a number line, including dot plots, histograms, and box plots.\"\n\n## SECTION II -- DATA AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nIn the first example of the lesson plan activity, we will be collecting data from the class (heights of students in inches), which adds more active learning to our lesson. This is easily reproducible for other teachers as well. For the data collection aspect, the instructor should first draw and label a blank dot plot distribution on the board. Label the horizontal, \"Student Heights\". Then, ask students to come to the board and mark their corresponding height in inches as a dot with a marker. For the handout problems, we used data on the number of pets for ten students ([from a 6th grade teaching Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xD0VAoyAyc&ab_channel=JoAnn%27sSchool)), the number of pages fifteen students read from their assigned novel during class (data we came up with), and a movie runtimes dataset from EngageNY. These datasets were chosen because they are age-appropriate, relatable, and small enough for 6th graders, therefore making it easier for them to understand boxplots.\n\nThis lesson will be using CODAP, the Common Online Data Analysis platform during the class discussion portion. The instructor will use CODAP data tables and graphing functionality to visualize each question in the handout as a dotplot, then check the \"box plot\" option on the dot plot distribution to lay a box plot above the dotplot. We are choosing to use CODAP as it saves more time for the instructor to visualize the dot plots/box plots instead of drawing the box plots on the whiteboard. Moreover, students will be able to see how the dot plot distribution compares to the box plot, as the box plot is placed above the dot plot in the same graph window.\n\n![](Screen Shot 2024-06-02 at 4.44.18 PM.png)\n\nAbove is an example of what the instructor would show students when discussing \"Part 2: Variability Among Students' Pets\" with the class. To use CODAP and make a dot plot/box plot visualization, the instructor should click the link provided above, then click \"Launch CODAP\" in the upper righthand corner. The instructor should then click \"Create new document\". To insert a table, click \"Tables\" in the upper left hand corner and fill in the table with desired data values. The instructor can change the name of the column by clicking \"AttributeName\", then \"Rename\". To create a dot plot, click \"Graph\" in the upper left hand corner. Drag the previously named \"AttributeName\" column to the bottom (horizontal) of the graph window. To add a boxplot, click on the ruler symbol after clicking on the graphing window, then check the box that says \"Box plot\" under \"Box Plot and Normal Curve\". The instructor can add the median line as shown in the picture above by checking the box that says \"Median\" under \"Measures of Center\". To display the median value labeled, check the box that says \"Show measure labels\".\n\n## SECTION III -- OUTLINE OF THE LESSON\n\n**Beginning of class**: We are not asking students to complete a reading assignment or any other work prior to coming to the lesson. While our first example utilizes student data collection, this is completed in class and does not require any prep work from the students. The instructor will start the class by having students come up and add their height to the whiteboard to collect data. Jumping right into a hands-on example before introducing definitions and calculations makes the lesson more relatable for students, especially for this grade level. The instructor will relate this to students' prior knowledge by first showing what the class data looks like in terms of a dot plot, before introducing the components of a box plot.\n\n**Middle of class**: The instructor will divide the lesson up into an introductory lecture portion, group-work portion for completing the handout, then complete the first portion of class with a class discussion of the handout answers and any questions/misconceptions that students need clarified. During the lecture portion, the instructor will work through the first problem of the handout with students, as it requires collecting class data of student heights and introduces new information regarding how to construct a boxplot. After this lecture, the instructor will randomly assign students to groups and have them work through the handout portion. The instructor will walk around the classroom with the answers to the handout, helping any students if asked.\n\nThe instructor will lecture for the first part of the lesson. During this lecture, the instructor will go straight into a hands-on example based on student heights. The instructor will create a blank dot plot distribution on the whiteboard, labeling the horizontal as \"Student Heights\". Then, students will be asked to come up to the whiteboard and place a dot on the distribution that correlates with their height in inches. After creating this dotplot and copying the distribution down on their handout, students will work with the instructor to answer all questions on \"Part 1: Variability Among Students' Heights\". First, students will answer some preliminary questions independently that they have previously seen before when learning about dot plots (i.e. calculation of median, identification of minimum and maximum values, and what one dot on the plot represents). After briefly going over these answers, the instructor will move on to introducing each component of the five number summary as provided on the handout. The instructor should mention that the median, minimum, and maximum values students previously found from the dot plot are a part of this summary. After introducing this, the instructor will go into discussing how to calculate and interpret quartile 1 and quartile 3 as provided in the handout. Then, students will be asked to independently calculate and interpret quartile 1 and quartile 3. The instructor should then mention that we now have all five components of our five number summary for creating the box plot. Lastly, the instructor will go into explaining the interquartile range, specifically how to calculate and interpret it. Students will then work independently on question nine, which includes calculating and interpreting the IQR related to the height data. Students will then use all these components to construct the boxplot in question ten.\n\nAfter the lecture portion of class, students will move on to \"Part 2: Variability Among Students' Pets\". Instead of working independently/with the instructor, students will work in groups of two with the person next to them to answer Part 2's question. Students will not be changing groups. The same partners will be together for the rest of class. To encourage cooperative learning, the instructor will tell students that after they complete the handout, the instructor will call on one student in their partner groups during the class discussion instead of asking for volunteers, encouraging individual accountability.\n\nWe are not planning to have discussions during activity, rather we will have a class discussion at the end, when students complete the handout. During the activity, the instructor will walk around the classroom to support students if any questions arise.\n\n**End of class and wrap-up**: After giving students ample time to finish the handout with a partner, the instructor will lead a class discussion going over each problem and randomly choosing students in their partner groups to share their answers. Here, we recommend teachers bring up the CODAP visualizations on the projector screen for each corresponding problem as they discuss the answers with the class. The instructor should move slowly through the discussion and pause for any questions that students may have. Then, the instructor should provide the exit ticket, asking students to independently answer four questions. The exit ticket asks students to match a boxplot to a given dotplot, calculate IQR, label the five-number summary on a boxplot, and create their own boxplot from a given dataset.\n\n## SECTION IV -- ACTIVITY AND LECTURE NOTES\n\nThe students will most likely struggle with the concepts of quartiles and the interquartile range, because this lesson would constitute students' first interaction with these topics. Student errors could be interpreting these concepts because of their unfamiliarity with it. Further, students might struggle with construction of the box plot, again, because it is their first time creating one. In order to help students without giving them the answers, we would refer back to the diagrams we placed on the handout, and re-explain those. For example, we have an in depth diagram on the handout regarding the calculation of the first and third quartiles, so we could slowly take students through that general example if they have trouble. The same applies to the box plot and interquartile range. Moreover, we will be referring to information from the dot plot to help students create the five number summary for the boxplot (i.e. \"what is the median of this dot plot?\", \"what are the minimum and maximum values?\", \" how can we use these values to create the boxplot?\".\n\nThe activity starts with a class activity gathering heights of students. The instructor should walk through this example step by step, giving students time to share their predictions by asking things like \"What do you expect the shape of this distribution to look like?\" During the group work portion, instructors should walk by groups and ask them specific questions to gauge understanding and progress on the activity. The instructor should make sure they are making eye contact and discussing with all members of the group to help balance each member's contributions and understanding. Teachers should observe which students are struggling more than others, even if the rest of their group seems to be going through the activity quickly. If one group is struggling more than others, move toward them more frequently to help with any questions. Observing these differences in individual students' comprehension of the activity will help the teacher conduct differentiated instruction. Have a copy of the activity on hand while walking around to the groups. Do not give the answers away; instead, ask questions that utilize scaffolding and provide opportunities for students to construct their own knowledge based on what they've learned already about dot plots, medians and more. Questions that prompt an explanation from students such as \"what do you notice about...\" or \"why is it that...\" will help guide students to the correct answers.\n\nWe did not use another activity as our inspiration for our lesson plan. However, data was used from a 6th grade teaching Youtube channel, JoAnn's School, for the dot plot in \"Part 2: Variability Among Students' Pets\". We took some inspiration from this channel's introduction of box plot topics (i.e. introduction of five number summary first, then IQR, then constructing a box plot).\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nCatherine Allen, Samarth Bala, Donya Behroozi, Michelle Hu, Akshat Telkar\n\n## SECTION I -- INTRODUCTION\n\nOur intended audience is a sixth grade introduction to statistics course.
