## Abstract

This project examined how K-12 school districts in the United States prevent and respond to staff-to-student sexual misconduct from 2017-2021. Our team examined 4700+ documents related to adverse actions from the 500 largest school districts in the U.S., state level licensure actions from 29 states, 4,940 google alerts for teachers arrested documented in news media articles, and the cost of civil lawsuits against school districts from 450+ cases. Our research explored how districts handle cases of sexual misconduct and other violations of Title IX, revealing alarming patterns of teacher offenses being inadequately addressed and, in some cases, swept under the rug only to resurface in another district. School districts and state certification agencies were reluctant to provide records. Findings revealed that 67% of separation documents included purposefully ambiguous language and 85% of documents did not include the information requested. Further research is needed to explore the loopholes in the hiring, investigation and remedial action for staff who engage in sexual misconduct with students.
